   * Create a general strategy for how you will accomplish the task:

      * How will you capture button clicks?
        .OnClick event the calls the button id
      * What will you do with the numbers clicked?
        *push that value property on to an array
        *using a .join operator display contents of array has the first header in results
      * What will you do when the operator is clicked?
        * stop array
        * display operator on next line
        * if another operator is pressed replace it
        * if you start typing in another number it will go into another array
      * How will you differentiate numbers from operators?
        *diffrentiate variables
      * How will you know the "value" of a number clicked?
      * How will you know when a user is done entering the first number?
      * Etc.

    * Create a few test "on-click" events. These could just trigger Alert messages for now. If you get further along, then have these buttons alert their "value".
